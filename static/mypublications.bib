abstract = {This study presents the aerosol radiative forcing derived from airborne measurements of shortwave spectral irradiance during the 2010 Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change (CalNex). Relative forcing efficiency, the radiative forcing normalized by aerosol optical thickness and incident irradiance, is a means of comparing the aerosol radiative forcing for different conditions. In this study, it is used to put the aerosol radiative effects ofan air mass in the Los Angeles basin in context with case studies from three field missions that targeted other regions and aerosol types, including a case study from the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS). For CalNex, we relied on irradiance measurements onboard the NOAA P-3 aircraft during a flight on 19 May 2010 over a ground station. CalNex presented a difficulty for determining forcing efficiency since one of the input parameters, optical thickness, was not available from the same aircraft. However, extinction profiles were available from a nearby aircraft. An existing retrieval algorithm was modified to use those measurements as initial estimate for the missing optical thickness. In addition, single scattering albedo and asymmetry parameter (secondary products of the method), were compared with CalNex in situ measurements. The CalNex relative forcing efficiency spectra agreed with earlier studies that found this parameter to be constrained at each wavelength within 20% per unit of aerosol optical thickness at 500 nm regardless of aerosol type and experiment, except for highly absorbing aerosols sampled near Mexico City. The diurnally averaged below-layer forcing efficiency integrated over the wavelength range of 350–700 nm for CalNex is estimated to be -58.6 +/- 13.8 W/m2, whereas for the ARCTAS case it is -48.7 +/- 11.5 W/m2.}

abstract = {Industry advances have greatly reduced the cost and size of ground-based shortwave (SW) sensors for the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectral ranges that make up the solar spectrum, while simultaneously increasing their ruggedness, reliability and calibration accuracy needed for outdoor operation. These sensors and collocated meteorological equipment are an important part of the US Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) User Facility, which has supported parallel integrated measurements of atmospheric and surface properties for more than two decades at fixed and mobile sites around the world. The versatile capability of these ground-based measurements includes: (1) rich spectral information required for retrieving cloud and aerosol microphysical properties, such as cloud phase, cloud particle size, and aerosol size distributions, and (2) high temporal resolution needed for capturing fast evolution of cloud microphysical properties in response to rapid changes in meteorological conditions. Here we describe examples of how ARM's spectral radiation measurements are being used to improve understanding of the complex processes governing microphysical, optical, and radiative properties of clouds and aerosol.The maturing of ground-based solar shortwave spectral measurements at the U.S. DOE ARM User Facility facilitates progress in climate predictability by constraining cloud and aerosol radiative effects in complex environments.},

abstract = {To help satellite retrieval of aerosols and studies of their radiative effects, we demonstrate that daytime aerosol optical depth over low-level clouds is similar to that in neighboring clear skies at the same heights. Based on recent airborne lidar and sun photometer observations above the southeast Atlantic, the mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) difference at 532 nm is between 0 and −0.01, when comparing the cloudy and clear sides, each up to 20 km wide, of cloud edges. The difference is not statistically significant according to a paired t test. Systematic differences in the wavelength dependence of AOD and in situ single scattering albedo are also minuscule. These results hold regardless of the vertical distance between cloud top and aerosol layer bottom. AOD aggregated over ∼2∘ grid boxes for each of September 2016, August 2017 and October 2018 also shows little correlation with the presence of low-level clouds. We posit that a satellite retrieval artifact is entirely responsible for a previous finding of generally smaller AOD over clouds (Chung et al., 2016), at least for the region and time of our study. Our results also suggest that the same values can be assumed for the intensive properties of free-tropospheric biomass-burning aerosol regardless of whether clouds are present below.},

abstract = {Southern Africa produces almost a third of the Earth's biomass burning (BB) aerosol particles, yet the fate of these particles and their influence on regional and global climate is poorly understood. ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) is a five-year NASA EVS-2 (Earth Venture Suborbital-2) investigation with three Intensive Observation Periods designed to study key atmospheric processes that determine the climate impacts of these aerosols. During the Southern Hemisphere winter and spring (June-October), aerosol particles reaching 3–5 km in altitude are transported westward over the South-East Atlantic, where they interact with one of the largest subtropical stratocumulus subtropical stratocumulus (Sc) cloud decks in the world. The representation of these interactions in climate models remains highly uncertain in part due to a scarcity of observational constraints on aerosol and cloud properties, and due to the parameterized treatment of physical processes. Three ORACLES deployments by the NASA P-3 aircraft in September 2016, August 2017 and October 2018 (totaling 350 science flight hours), augmented by the deployment of the NASA ER-2 aircraft for remote sensing in September 2016 (totaling 100 science flight hours), were intended to help fill this observational gap. ORACLES focuses on three fundamental science questions centered on the climate effects of African BB aerosols: (a) direct aerosol radiative effects; (b) effects of aerosol absorption on atmospheric circulation and clouds; (c) aerosol-cloud microphysical interactions. This paper summarizes the ORACLES science objectives, describes the project implementation, provides an overview of the flights and measurements in each deployment, and highlights the integrative modeling efforts from cloud to global scales to address science objectives. Significant new findings on the vertical structure of BB aerosol physical and chemical properties, chemical aging, cloud condensation nuclei, rain and precipitation statistics, and aerosol indirect effects are emphasized, but their detailed descriptions are the subject of separate publications. The main purpose of this paper is to familiarize the broader scientific community with the ORACLES project and the data set it produced.},

abstract = {This study presents and evaluates an updated algorithm for quantification of absorbing aerosols above clouds (AACs) from passive satellite measurements. The focus is biomass burning in the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean during the 2016 and 2017 ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES) field campaign deployments. The algorithm retrieves the above-cloud aerosol optical depth (AOD) and underlying liquid cloud optical depth and is applied to measurements from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) from 1997 to 2017. Airborne NASA Ames Spectrometers for Sky-Scanning, Sun-Tracking Atmospheric Research (4STAR) and NASA Langley High Spectral Resolution Lidar 2 (HSRL2) data collected during ORACLES provide important validation for spectral AOD for MODIS and VIIRS; as the SeaWiFS mission ended in 2010, it cannot be evaluated directly. The 4STAR and HSRL2 comparisons are complementary and reveal performance generally in line with uncertainty estimates provided by the optimal estimation retrieval framework used. At present the two MODIS-based data records seem the most reliable, although there are differences between the deployments, which may indicate that the available data are not yet sufficient to provide a robust regional validation. Spatiotemporal patterns in the data sets are similar, and the time series are very strongly correlated with each other (correlation coefficients from 0.95 to 0.99). Offsets between the satellite data sets are thought to be chiefly due to differences in absolute calibration between the sensors. The available validation data for this type of algorithm are limited to a small number of field campaigns, and it is strongly recommended that such airborne measurements continue to be made, both over the southern Atlantic Ocean and elsewhere.},

abstract = {All-sky Direct Aerosol Radiative Effects (DARE) play a significant yet still uncertain role in climate. This is partly due to poorly quantified radiative properties of Aerosol Above Clouds (AAC). We compute global estimates of short-wave top-of-atmosphere DARE over Opaque Water Clouds (OWC), DARE{\textless}sub{\textgreater}OWC{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, using observation-based aerosol and cloud radiative properties from a combination of A-Train satellite sensors and a radiative transfer model. There are three major differences between our DARE{\textless}sub{\textgreater}OWC{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} calculations and previous studies: (1) we use the Depolarization Ratio method (DR) on CALIOP (Cloud Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization) Level 1 measurements to compute the AAC frequencies of occurrence and the AAC Aerosol Optical Depths (AOD), thus introducing fewer uncertainties compared to using the CALIOP standard product; (2) we apply our calculations globally, instead of focusing exclusively on regional AAC {\textless}q{\textgreater}hotspots{\textless}/q{\textgreater} such as the southeast Atlantic; and (3) instead of the traditional look-up table approach, we use a combination of satellite-based sensors to obtain AAC intensive radiative properties. Our results agree with previous findings on the dominant locations of AAC (South and North East Pacific, Tropical and South East Atlantic, northern Indian Ocean and North West Pacific), the season of maximum occurrence, aerosol optical depths (a majority in the 0.01{\&}ndash;0.02 range and that can exceed 0.2 at 532{\&}thinsp;nm) and aerosol extinction-to-backscatter ratios (a majority in the 40{\&}ndash;50{\&}thinsp;sr range at 532{\&}thinsp;nm which is typical of dust aerosols) over the globe. We find positive averages of global seasonal DARE{\textless}sub{\textgreater}OWC{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} between 0.13 and 0.26{\&}thinsp;W{\&}thinsp;{\&}middot;{\&}thinsp;m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} (i.e., a warming effect on climate). Regional seasonal DARE{\textless}sub{\textgreater}OWC{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} values range from {\&}minus;0.06{\&}thinsp;W{\&}thinsp;{\&}middot;{\&}thinsp;m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in the Indian Ocean, offshore from western Australia (in March{\&}ndash;April{\&}ndash;May) to 2.87{\&}thinsp;W{\&}thinsp;{\&}middot;{\&}thinsp;m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in the South East Atlantic (in September{\&}ndash;October{\&}ndash;November). High positive values are usually paired with high aerosol optical depths ({\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;0.1) and low single scattering albedos ({\textless}{\&}thinsp;0.94), representative of, e.g., biomass burning aerosols. Because we use different spatial domains, temporal periods, satellite sensors, detection methods, and/or associated uncertainties, the DARE{\textless}sub{\textgreater}OWC{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} estimates in this study are not directly comparable to previous peer-reviewed results. Despite these differences, we emphasize that the DARE{\textless}sub{\textgreater}OWC{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} estimates derived in this study are generally higher than previously reported. The primary reasons for our higher estimates are (i) the possible underestimate of the number of dust-dominated AAC cases in our study; (ii) our use of Level 1 CALIOP products (instead of CALIOP Level 2 products in previous studies) for the detection and quantification of AAC aerosol optical depths, which leads to larger estimates of AOD above OWC; and (iii) our use of gridded 4{\&}deg;{\&}thinsp;{\&}times;{\&}thinsp;5{\&}deg; seasonal means of aerosol and cloud properties in our DARE{\textless}sub{\textgreater}OWC{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} calculations instead of simultaneously derived aerosol and cloud properties from a combination of A-Train satellite sensors. Each of these areas is explored in depth with detailed discussions that explain both rationale for our specific approach and the subsequent ramifications for our DARE calculations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The amplitude and spectral shape of shortwave radiation are used to retrieve aerosol and cloud properties from airborne and ground based measurements. By interacting with clouds and aerosols in the Earth's atmosphere, the wavelength-dependent radiation emitted by the sun is modified. This thesis presents the change in radiation due to absorption and scattering by clouds and aerosols, which result in distinct spectral signatures in shortwave radiation spectra. The spectral signature in shortwave radiation due to aerosols is quantified by airborne measurements of irradiance above and below aerosol layers. This radiative effect is quantified by the relative forcing efficiency, which is used to compare the impact of aerosols from different air masses, locations, and time of day. The relative forcing efficiency is the net irradiance change due to the presence of aerosols normalized by aerosol optical thickness and incident irradiance. It is shown to vary by less than 20{\%} per unit of midvisible aerosol optical thickness for aerosols sampled during 4 different experiments, except for highly absorbing aerosols near Mexico City. The similarity in relative forcing efficiency for these experiments, not expected a priori, suggests that this quantity is constrained for various types of aerosols with differing scattering and absorption characteristics even when surface albedo differs. To estimate the radiative effect of aerosols sampled in the Los Angeles basin during one of the experiments, where no concurrent measurements of optical thickness with spectral irradiance were available, a new iterative technique was devised to use aerosol optical thickness measurements from another airborne platform. Cloud-transmitted zenith radiance spectra were measured from the ground in Boulder, Colorado. In these measurements, spectral signatures of cloud optical and microphysical properties were uncovered. The spectral signatures are the result of radiation that is transmitted through clouds, where ice or liquid water cloud particles modulate the radiation by absorbing and scattering incident light in a wavelength-dependent manner. Typically, the magnitudes of radiance at 2 wavelengths have been used to retrieve cloud properties, but by using wavelength-dependent features more sensitivity to cloud microphysical properties is obtained. This thesis presents a method to analyze wavelength-dependent signal, where spectral features such as slopes, curvatures, and shifts in locations of maxima and minima are parameterized. These spectral features found in normalized radiance are quantified by introducing 15 parameters. These 15 parameters form the basis of a new generalized retrieval obtaining cloud optical thickness ($\tau$), effective radius (re), and ther- modynamic phase ($\phi$). When applied to a liquid water cloud case, this retrieval matched a measured transmittance spectrum with a smaller root mean square difference over the entire spectrum (3.1{\%}) than two other methods (up to 6.4{\%}). To quantify the retrieval over all possible combinations of $\tau$, re, and $\phi$, simulated measurements were used in conjunction with realistic measurement and model error characteristics. By combining these error characteristics within the GEneralized Nonlinear Retrieval Analysis (GENRA) a solution probability distributions can be built. The information of cloud properties contained within cloud-transmitted radiance is greater on average for liquid water clouds than for ice clouds. For all possible combinations of cloud properties, radiance transmitted through clouds with $\tau$ {\textless}20 contain the most information on cloud properties, indicating that the 15 parameters have greatest sensitivity to cloud properties of optically thin clouds ($\tau$ {\textless}20). Of the 15 parameters, only 10 are required to retrieve accurately $\tau$, re, and $\phi$ for any cloud except for ice clouds with $\tau$ {\textgreater}25 and re {\textgreater}30 µm. Using this retrieval, the correct thermodynamic phase is determined from transmittance with a probability greater than 99.4{\%} for horizontally homogeneous clouds that contain either ice or liquid water cloud particles.},

abstract = {Abstract. In the southeast Atlantic, well-defined smoke plumes from Africa advect over marine boundary layer cloud decks; both are most extensive around September, when most of the smoke resides in the free troposphere. A framework is put forth for evaluating the performance of a range of global and regional atmospheric composition models against observations made during the NASA ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) airborne mission in September 2016. A strength of the comparison is a focus on the spatial distribution of a wider range of aerosol composition and optical properties than has been done previously. The sparse airborne observations are aggregated into approximately 2∘ grid boxes and into three vertical layers: 3–6 km, the layer from cloud top to 3 km, and the cloud-topped marine boundary layer. Simulated aerosol extensive properties suggest that the flight-day observations are reasonably representative of the regional monthly average, with systematic deviations of 30 {\%} or less. Evaluation against observations indicates that all models have strengths and weaknesses, and there is no single model that is superior to all the others in all metrics evaluated. Whereas all six models typically place the top of the smoke layer within 0–500 m of the airborne lidar observations, the models tend to place the smoke layer bottom 300–1400 m lower than the observations. A spatial pattern emerges, in which most models underestimate the mean of most smoke quantities (black carbon, extinction, carbon monoxide) on the diagonal corridor between 16∘ S, 6∘ E, and 10∘ S, 0∘ E, in the 3–6 km layer, and overestimate them further south, closer to the coast, where less aerosol is present. Model representations of the above-cloud aerosol optical depth differ more widely. Most models overestimate the organic aerosol mass concentrations relative to those of black carbon, and with less skill, indicating model uncertainties in secondary organic aerosol processes. Regional-mean free-tropospheric model ambient single scattering albedos vary widely, between 0.83 and 0.93 compared with in situ dry measurements centered at 0.86, despite minimal impact of humidification on particulate scattering. The modeled ratios of the particulate extinction to the sum of the black carbon and organic aerosol mass concentrations (a mass extinction efficiency proxy) are typically too low and vary too little spatially, with significant inter-model differences. Most models overestimate the carbonaceous mass within the offshore boundary layer. Overall, the diversity in the model biases suggests that different model processes are responsible. The wide range of model optical properties requires further scrutiny because of their importance for radiative effect estimates.},

abstract = {The research focuses on airborne measurement conducted over the Beaufort Sea during September 2014. We compare our airborne measurement to predicted fields by reanalysis model and use both to reconstruct the surface radiative fluxes and compare them. We find that the reanalysis overestimates near-surface temperatures over open water areas and also over sea ice-covered areas. However, it underestimates relative humidity and clouds close to the surface. Comparing the simulated surface fluxes, we found that the reanalysis shows higher (more positive) surface fluxes in compare with measurements. It also underestimates the amount of ice water content in the low-level Arctic clouds during this time of the year, which results in an overestimation of the predicted fluxes by the model in comparison with those from observations. Overall, we found that cloud vertical structure and water content are the main difference sources (explain more than 70% of the differences) between observation and the modeled fields, with cloud phase and atmospheric parameters second (explain ~20% of the differences).}
