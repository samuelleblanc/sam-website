abstract = "An optical fiber vibration/acoustic sensor based on polarization diversity scheme has been developed to study the vibration of the highway pavement slabs with vehicles passing. This process induced the birefringence change in a 50m sensing fiber embedded along the FRP bars. The damping of the impact in time domain and a 2Hz vibration frequency are observed."
