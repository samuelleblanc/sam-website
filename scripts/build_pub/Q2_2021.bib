abstract = {The southeast Atlantic has expansive aerosol plumes overlying clouds for a third of each year. Aerosol optical depths (AODs) were measured from the airborne Sun photometer and lidar during the 2016 NASA ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS field campaign. We compare these measurements with one another and with collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations at native spatial resolutions using <15-min and 3-h temporal collocation criteria. We find better statistical relationships for the <15-min temporal resolution, indicating that AODs in the southeast Atlantic commonly vary below three-hourly temporal scales over MODIS spatial resolutions. We also use the airborne Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR) to conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of attenuation-corrected below-aerosol cloud optical depths (CODs) from MODIS and the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). MODIS COD retrievals improve their agreement with the SSFR when accounting for overlying aerosol attenuation whereas SEVIRI CODs are mostly underestimated.}

abstract = {Abstract. This work establishes an observationally-driven link from mid-visible aerosol optical depth (AOD) and other scene parameters to broadband shortwave irradiance (and by extension, the direct aerosol radiative effect, DARE), based on observations from the 2016 and 2017 field campaigns of ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS). Specifically, this is done by two parameterizations, one spanned by the mid-visible AOD and scene albedo below the aerosol layer, and another one with a third input, the mid-visible aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA). These parameterizations build on the earlier concept of radiative forcing efficiency, which describes the dependence of DARE on the AOD, and extend it to make the dependence on the other two scene parameters explicit. The parameterizations are founded on 9 cases from the campaigns, for which we retrieve the spectral aerosol properties of SSA and asymmetry parameter (g) directly from the radiative fluxes, based on the method presented in Cochrane et al. (2019). These properties are used as the basis of the parameterizations, capturing the natural variability of the study region as sampled. The majority of the case-to-case variability within the ORACLES DARE dataset is attributable to the dependence on AOD and scene albedo. This is captured by the first parameterization, which is advantageous when satellite retrievals provide only limited information such as AOD and scene albedo. However, the second parameterization explains even more of the case-to-case variability by introducing the mid-visible SSA as third parameter. For both parameterizations, we provide the necessary coefficients, uncertainties, and code required for the user to reconstruct the parameterization for their use.},

abstract = {Marine stratocumulus cloud properties over the Southeast Atlantic Ocean are impacted by contact between above-cloud biomass burning aerosols and cloud tops. Different vertical separations (0 to 2000 m) between the aerosol layer and cloud tops were observed on six research flights in September 2016 during the NASA ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES) field campaign. There were 30 contact profiles, where an aerosol layer with aerosol concentration (Na) > 500 cm-3 was within 100 m of cloud tops, and 41 separated profiles, where the aerosol layer with Na > 500 cm-3 was located more than 100 m above cloud tops. For contact profiles, the average cloud droplet concentration (Nc) in the cloud layer was up to 68 cm-3 higher, the effective radius (Re) up to 1.3 $\mu$ m lower, and the liquid water content (LWC) within 0.01 gm-3 compared to separated profiles. Free-tropospheric humidity was higher in the presence of biomass burning aerosols, and contact profiles had a smaller decrease in humidity (and positive buoyancy) across cloud tops with higher median above-cloud Na (895 cm-3) compared to separated profiles (30 cm-3). Due to droplet evaporation from entrainment mixing of warm, dry free-tropospheric air into the clouds, the median Nc and LWC for contact profiles decreased with height by 21 and 9 % in the top 20 % of the cloud layer. The impact of droplet evaporation was stronger during separated profiles as a greater decrease in humidity (and negative buoyancy) across cloud tops led to greater decreases in median Nc (30 %) and LWC (16 %) near cloud tops. Below-cloud Na was sampled during 61 profiles, and most contact profiles (20 out of 28) were within high-Na (> 350 cm-3) boundary layers, while most separated profiles (22 out of 33) were within low-Na (< 350 cm-3) boundary layers. Although the differences in below-cloud Na were statistically insignificant, contact profiles within lowNa boundary layers had up to 34.9 cm-3 higher Nc compared to separated profiles. This is consistent with a weaker impact of droplet evaporation in the presence of biomass burning aerosols within 100 m above cloud tops. For contact profiles within high-Na boundary layers, the presence of biomass burning aerosols led to higher below-cloud Na (up to 70.5 cm-3) and additional droplet nucleation above the cloud base along with weaker droplet evaporation. Con sequently, the contact profiles in high-Na boundary layers had up to 88.4 cm-3 higher Nc compared to separated profiles. These results motivate investigations of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions over the Southeast Atlantic since the changes in Nc and Re induced by the presence of abovecloud biomass burning aerosols are likely to impact precipitation rates, liquid water path, and cloud fraction, and modulate closed-to-open-cell transitions.},
