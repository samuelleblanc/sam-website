title: moving lines
summary: The research flight planning tool 'moving lines' has been developped by Sam. It incorporates many visual interfaces and spreadsheets to plan out sampling strategies for achieving success in Airborne Science deployments. Moving lines reduces effort invested by scientists deciding on flight paths with respect to science objectives, aircraft performance, airspace availability, meteorological and sampling conditions, airborne instruments needed, and coordination between airborne research platforms.
